Part 1: Performed Gradient on Boston Dataset to train the model and then made predictions on the testing data
Part 2: Trained the model by data from a Combined Cycle Power Plant collected over 6 years using Gradient Descent. The features consisted of temperature, ambient pressure, relative humidity and exhaust vacuum to predict Net hourly electrical energy output
